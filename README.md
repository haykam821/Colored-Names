Gives each player a consistent default username color.

Colored Names requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Colored Names from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colored-names/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Colored-Names/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

Each player and entity will automatically be given a display name color. This color is based on their UUID, meaning it stays consistent even after a player changes their username. The color is overridden by any team colors.
